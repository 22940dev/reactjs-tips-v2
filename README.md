## React Cheat Sheet

Hi! Thanks for wanting to contribute. I hope your experience is pretty painless.

### Contributing

#### Clone the repo

    git clone https://github.com/chantastic/react-cheat-sheet.git

#### Setup the project

    cd react-cheat-sheet
    npm install

#### Start webpack

    npm start

This will start a webpack process that watches the filesystem for changes.

I don't have any type of web-server at the moment. I typically just open `index.html` from the file system. If you feel you need one, you can run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

#### Commit and PR into `master`

Commit your changes and PR into `master`. If everything looks good, I'll merge it and run a build on the `gh-pages` branch.

Cheers!

Chan
